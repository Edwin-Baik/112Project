112 Project involving ZombieVille
Created a game using the PyGame module that correlated heavily with collision detection, sprite usage, and a variety of other built-in functions within Python.

This project is a rough parody of the movements and gunplay that is introduced in the game "Zombieville", with multiple zombies and guns being introduced throughout the level.
